## ðŸ”¥ What I'm Building

I engineer scalable solutions at the intersection of blockchain technology and quantitative finance. My focus is on creating robust systems that bridge traditional algorithmic trading with decentralized infrastructure.

**Current Focus Areas:**
- **High-Frequency DeFi Infrastructure** - Optimizing on-chain execution
- **Cross-Exchange Liquidity Aggregation** - Building smarter routing protocols
- **MEV-Resistant Trading Systems** - Developing strategies that protect users
- **Real-Time Market Intelligence** - Advanced data pipelines for alpha generation
